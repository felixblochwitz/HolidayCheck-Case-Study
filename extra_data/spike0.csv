Now, Donald Trump has reportedly added a 200-year-old battle to his litany of complaints against the United States’ northern neighbor.  During a tetchy phone call last month to discuss looming steel and aluminum tariffs, Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, reportedly asked how Trump could justify the new duties on national security grounds.  In reply, Trump asked, according to CNN: “Didn’t you guys burn down the White House?” The White House did not respond to a request for comment and Canadian officials declined to comment on the record. The White House was burned by British troops in 1814 as part of a failed invasion of the mid-Atlantic, more than 50 years before the signing of Canada’s confederation paved the way for the founding of modern-day Canada.  Although the British successfully took Washington and burned much of the city, they failed in their major goal of taking Baltimore when their forces were rebuffed at the battle of Fort McHenry. Canada was a major battleground during the conflict – known as the war of 1812 – which played a significant part in the creation of the Canadian national identity. Trump’s comments come at a time of increased tensions between the US and Canada, shortly before the US president unilaterally announced increased tariffs without congressional approval, citing national security needs.  The border between the US and Canada has been demilitarized for two centuries. Trump’s justification for the new duties has provoked outrage from Canadians.

The US president, who arrived at the summit in Canada late and left early to fly to Singapore to prepare for his summit with Kim Jong-un, shocked fellow leaders with a bellicose press conference on Saturday in which he attacked the trade policies of other countries. 
The US had nevertheless appeared to agree a form of words on contentious issues thanks to an all-night negotiating session by officials from all sides. 
But after leaving for Singapore, Trump tweeted personal attacks on Trudeau and said that he had told his representatives not to sign the summit communique, turning what had already been a tense meeting of the world’s leading industrialised democracies into a fiasco.  
“PM Justin Trudeau acted so meek and mild,” he tweeted. “Only to give a news conference after I left saying that ‘US tariffs were kind of insulting’ and ‘he will not be pushed around’. 
“Very dishonest and weak” he claimed, adding in a separate tweet: “I have instructed our US reps not to endorse the communique.” 
 
 
  Based on Justin’s false statements at his news conference, and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U.S. farmers, workers and companies, I have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!— Donald J.

Journalists traveling on Air Force One to Singapore with Trump had been told that the US had decided to be part of the joint communique, which represented a minimal show of unity amid deep disagreements between Trump and the other six leaders over trade. The reporters only discovered when the plane landed on the Greek island of Crete to refuel that the president had changed his mind. 
Even for a presidency as capricious as Trump’s, his action marked a new blurring of lines between his personal feelings towards other leaders, and US government policy. It was also the latest example of Trump’s use of much harsher language towards fellow democratically-elected leaders of allied countries than to strongmen leaders of enemy and adversary nations. 
A few minutes before Trump sent out his inflammatory tweets, his hawkish national security security adviser, John Bolton, appeared to anticipate them by sending a tweet of his own, deriding the G7 summit he had just attended. 
“Just another G7 where other countries expect America will always be their bank. The President made it clear today. No more,” Bolton said.  
Bolton has been sidelined in talks with the North Koreans, but the last-minute turnaround on the G7 represents a win for his unilateralist approach to US foreign policy. 
The tweets also represent a blow to the French president Emmanuel Macron and the German chancellor Angela Merkel, who believed they had brokered a deal to smooth over tensions on US-European trade.

The communique said the leaders of the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Italy, Germany and Japan agreed on the need for “free, fair, and mutually beneficial trade” and the importance of fighting protectionism. 
“We strive to reduce tariff barriers, non-tariff barriers and subsidies,” the statement said.  
Like last year, the communique made it clear that the US had a different view on climate change and how to fight it from the other six leaders, increasingly being referred to informally as the G6. 
Governments tried to shore up the damage late on Saturday with statements backing the form of words they thought had been agreed.

“We are focused on everything we accomplished here at the #G7 summit,” a spokesman for Trudeau tweeted. “The prime minister said nothing he hasn’t said before – both in public, and in private conversations with the president.”  
A senior UK government source said it stood by the commitments made in the communiqué, while a European Union official at the summit said it would “stick to the commitments made by all participants”. 
The sensitive trade issue was the subject of Trump’s unscheduled press conference on Saturday morning. After slapping tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, the European Union and Mexico last week, Trump threatened at the summit to cut off trade with countries that treated the United States unfairly.  
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
“We’re like the piggy bank that everybody is robbing,” he told reporters.  
But Trudeau, in the media conference that irked Trump, rejected a US demand for a sunset clause in the North American trade agreement, Nafta, that would allow a member nation to withdraw after five years.  
“There will not be a sunset clause ... we will not, cannot sign a trade deal that expires automatically every five years,” he said. 
Trudeau said he had told Trump that the talks had been made more complicated by last week’s imposition of tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, ostensibly for national security reasons. Canada has promised retaliatory measures on 1 July.  
“I highlighted directly to the president that Canadians did not take it lightly that the United States has moved forward with significant tariffs,” said Trudeau. “Canadians, we’re polite, we’re reasonable, but we will also not be pushed around.”",2018-06-10 04:26:16+02:00

In an extraordinary interview with CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, Larry Kudlow, who was present for negotiations at the G7 summit in Quebec over the weekend, said Trudeau had instigated “a betrayal” and was “essentially double-crossing President Trump”. 
Trudeau used a media conference on Saturday to reject a US demand for a sunset clause in the North American trade agreement, Nafta, that Trump has at different times pressed to abolish or renegotiate. The prime minister also said Canada would “move forward with retaliatory measures” in response to the Trump administration’s move to impose tariffs on aluminium and steel imports from the European Union, Mexico and Canada.

The move enraged Trump, who branded his Canadian counterpart “dishonest and weak” in a furious tweet, announcing the US would pull out of an agreed communique.  
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
The G7 communique said the leaders of seven of the most powerful countries in the world agreed on the need for “free, fair and mutually beneficial trade” and the importance of fighting protectionism. 
Kudlow added that Trump had made the decision to pull out of the agreement in an attempt to save face ahead of his historic summit with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in Singapore.  
“Potus [the president of the United States] is not going to let a Canadian prime minister push him around – push him, Potus around, on the eve of this,” Kudlow said. “He is not going to permit any show of weakness on the trip to negotiate with North Korea. Nor should he.”

Trump continued the onslaught against Trudeau on Monday, tweeting from Singapore.

Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro appeared on Fox News Sunday and said Trudeau deserved “a special place in hell”. 
“There’s a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with President Donald J Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door, and that’s what Bad Faith Justin Trudeau did with that stunt press conference,” Navarro said, adding that his comments had come “right from Air Force One”. 
Kudlow, a staunch conservative who regularly pounded his fists on the desk throughout his interview on CNN, argued that Trudeau’s comments were “a great disservice to the whole G7”.  
A representative of Trudeau did not respond to a request for comment but Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters in Quebec City: “Canada does not conduct its diplomacy through ad hominem attacks … and we refrain particularly from ad hominem attacks when it comes from a close ally.” 
Leaders of other G7 member states hit back at the Trump administration’s decision to pull out of the joint statement. The office of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, issued a statement saying cooperation on the international stage “cannot be dictated by fits of anger and throwaway remarks”. 
The statement continued: “We spend two days working out a [joint] statement and commitments. We are sticking to them and whoever reneges on them is showing incoherence and inconsistency.”

The office of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, published a suggestive photograph showing Trump surrounded by other leaders. German foreign minister Heiko Maas wrote on Twitter: “You can destroy an incredible amount of trust very quickly in a tweet. That makes it all the more important that Europe stands together and defends its interests even more offensively.” 
Merkel later told ARD television: “The withdrawal, so to speak, via tweet is of course ... sobering and a bit depressing.” 
Donald Tusk, president of the European council, sent a tweet in rebuke of Navarro’s comment. There was “a special place in heaven”, Tusk said, for Trudeau, whom the former Polish prime minister thanked for the “perfect organization” of the summit.

The Trump administration’s move also received domestic criticism, from both moderate Republicans and Democrats.  
In a statement published on Twitter the Republican Arizona senator John McCain said: “To our allies: bipartisan majorities of Americans remain pro-free trade, pro-globalization &amp; supportive of alliances based on 70 years of shared values. Americans stand with you, even if our president doesn’t.” 
Dianne Feinstein, the senior Democratic senator from California, told CNN that “to walk away from our allies in this way” was “a mistake”.  
“[The] rules-based international order is being challenged,” she said.

Related: Trump says Trudeau's criticism of him will cost Canada 'a lot of money'    Speaking at a conference in Washington on Tuesday, Navarro said his “job” in appearing on Fox News Sunday in the chaotic aftermath of the G7 summit in Quebec had been “to send a signal of strength”. “The problem was that in conveying that message I used language that was inappropriate,” he said. “I own that. That was my mistake, those were my words.” On Sunday, Navarro told Fox host Chris Wallace he was communicating “the sentiment that was on Air Force One”. Canada’s prime minister earned Trump’s ire by giving a press conference, after the US president left La Malbaie, in which he spoke critically of US trade policy and said Canada would “move forward with retaliatory measures” in response to Trump’s move to impose tariffs on aluminum and steel. Trump was by then on his way to his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, having left the G7 early and after a press conference of his own in which he complained about trade. He reacted to Trudeau’s remarks by withdrawing the US from a G7 communique and criticising the prime minister fiercely by tweet. The next morning, Navarro and chief economics adviser Larry Kudlow were deployed to the Sunday talk shows. In a display of calculated aggression, Kudlow thumped the table as he told CNN’s State of the Union Trudeau had “stabbed us in the back” and instigated “a betrayal”. Navarro then appeared on Fox News Sunday.   Related: Canada and America are cousins.

That’s what Weak Dishonest Justin Trudeau did and that comes right from Air Force One.” Responding, Wallace said: “You used some very strong words, ‘stab in the back’, ‘a special place in hell’. You said that that came from Air Force One. Are those the …words of the president towards Trudeau?” Navarro said: “Those were my words but they’re the sentiment that was on Air Force One.”",2018-06-12 19:29:39+02:00
