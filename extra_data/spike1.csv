Singh, the first non-white leader of a major party in Canada, was under immense pressure to win the highly anticipated race in Burnaby, a city east of Vancouver. “Friends, we made history today,” he told supporters. “When I was growing up, I could have never imagined someone like me running to be prime minister.” Calling the victory “incredible”, Singh pledged to fight for Canada’s middle class and took direct aim at growing fears of xenophobia in the country. The rookie leader, who has been seen as an energising force in Canadian politics, will have a place in the House of Commons, allowing him to spar with other leaders and the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, ahead of the election.   Related: Canada: Jagmeet Singh faces existential byelection on road to challenge Trudeau    The victory was critical for the party leader: amid sagging poll numbers nationally and fundraising difficulties for the party, senior members had cast doubts over his future leadership had he not secured the win. “Jagmeet Singh has always been underestimated,” his brother Gurratan Singh tweeted as results were reported. “And he always proves them wrong.” Typically, leaders of federal parties in Canada decline to run competitive candidates when another leader is seeking a seat. The Liberal party, as well as the Conservatives and the People’s party, all ran candidates in the Burnaby South electoral district. The Green party chose not to run a candidate. The closely watched byelection was not without controversy. In January, Liberal candidate Karen Wang was forced to step aside after making racially charged remarks about Singh.  “If we can increase the voting rate, as the only Chinese candidate in this riding, if I can garner 16,000 votes I will easily win the by-election, control the election race and make history!” she wrote on WeChat. “My opponent in this by-election is the NDP candidate Singh of Indian descent!”   Related: Justin Trudeau’s image of transparency threatened by scandal    The text was widely condemned by both the NDP and the Liberals. Wang stepped down at the request of Trudeau. While the win is a relief for Singh, the electoral district of Burnaby South is widely viewed as an NDP stronghold. In two other byelections across the country, the NDP lost Outremont, handing over the Quebec seat once held by its former leader to the Liberal party candidate, Rachel Bendayan. In the Ontario seat of York-Simcoe, won by Conservative Scot Davidson, independent candidate John “The Engineer” Turmel, who holds the world record for the most contested elections, kept his streak going, notching his 96th loss –with less than 1% of the vote.",2019-02-26 08:15:24+01:00

His comments came after Canada’s former minister of justice and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould described a consistent, sustained and inappropriate effort by senior officials close to the prime minister who were attempting to dissuade her from prosecuting a Canadian engineering company accused of bribery. In searing testimony to the justice committee on Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould said the pressure on her included “veiled threats” if she did not acquiesce. “I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada in an inappropriate effort,” she said in her opening statement. Wilson-Raybould’s appearance before the committee marked her first public comments on the scandal, which has become the biggest crisis of Trudeau’s administration.   Related: The pioneering ex-minister at the centre of a Canadian scandal    In early February, the Globe and Mail reported that aides close to the prime minister had lobbied Wilson-Raybould to abandon plans to prosecute Quebec-based engineering company SNC Lavalin over accusations of fraud and bribery. Instead, they requested she pursue a “deferred prosecution agreement”, which allowed the company to pay a fine. Wilson-Raybould said she was “barraged” and subjected to “hounding” by members of the government. According to contemporaneous notes taken after each interaction, Wilson-Raybould recalled 10 phone calls and 10 meetings regarding the case. Wilson-Raybould also detailed a meeting with Trudeau, in which the prime minister said that – as a member of parliament from Quebec – he was concerned by the issue of SNC Lavalin jobs in the province, and asked her to “help out” with the case. “Are you politically interfering with my role as attorney general? I would strongly advise against it,” Wilson-Raybould recalled telling the prime minister. “No, no, no, we just need to find a solution,” she said, recalling the prime minister’s answer. On Wednesday night, Trudeau said it had been a “difficult few weeks” because of internal disagreements in his party, but rejected opposition calls to resign. He said he completely disagreed with Wilson-Raybould, saying that the decision to avoid prosecuting SNC-Lavalin was hers and hers alone. Wilson-Raybould also described a conversation with the government’s top civil servant, Michael Wernick, who advised her the prime minister wanted to “find a way to get it done, one way or another. She characterized the discussions as “treading on dangerous ground”. Last week, Wernick told the same committee that no improper pressure was applied to Wilson-Raybould. Trudeau’s government has been on the defensive since the Globe and Mail newspaper reported on 7 February that Trudeau or his staff pressured her to try to avoid a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin over allegations of corruption involving government contracts in Libya. Wilson-Raybould refused to abandon the prosecution, and four months later, she was abruptly demoted to the position of veteran affairs minister – a move which she saw as a direct consequence. “I can’t help but think this ha[d] something to do with a decision I would not take,” she told the committee. Following her demotion, she had “thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre,” Wilson-Raybould testified, in a reference to Richard Nixon’s purge of US justice department officials during the Watergate scandal. Under growing pressure, Trudeau denied that his office had “directed” Wilson-Raybould, and said her presence in his cabinet was proof of their amicable relationship. She resigned hours later and retained the former supreme court justice Thomas Cromwell as her counsel.   Related: Justin Trudeau’s image of transparency threatened by scandal    Opinion polls show the allegations are starting to hurt the Liberals ahead of what looks set to be a tightly contested federal election against the official opposition Conservative party in October. Opposition lawmakers accuse Trudeau of trying to cover up an attempt by officials to help SNC-Lavalin, which could be banned from bidding for federal contracts for a decade if found guilty. “Justin Trudeau can no longer hide the fact that he was at the center of an attempt to interfere in a criminal prosecution. He must come clean with Canadians,” Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said on Wednesday before the testimony. Scheer called on Trudeau to stand down and demanded a police inquiry. “He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,” he said. The scandal has already cost Trudeau his closest adviser: Gerald Butts resigned earlier this month, but denied he had or others had improperly pressured Wilson-Raybould. “What I hear today should make Canadians upset,” Murray Rankin, a member of the New Democratic party, told Wilson-Raybould during the committee hearing. Wilson-Raybould was granted a partial waiver of solicitor-client privilege in order to testify on Wednesday, but remains unable to speak about the content of her communications with Trudeau. Wilson-Raybould, a Kwakwaka’wakw lawyer from British Columbia, was Canada’s first indigenous attorney general, and her inclusion in the cabinet was initially seen as proof of Trudeau’s attempt to reset its relationship with indigenous peoples. “I was taught to always hold true to your core values, principles and to act with integrity,” said Wilson-Raybould at the conclusion of her statement. “I come from a long line of matriarchs and I am a truth-teller in accordance with the laws and traditions of our big house. This is who I am and who I always will be.”",2019-02-28 02:42:30+01:00

Trudeau acknowledged that his former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, could be removed from the Liberal party, telling reporters on Thursday that he would have to review fully her recent testimony on the deepening scandal before making a decision. 
“My team and I have always acted in a professional manner,” Trudeau told reporters on Thursday morning, rejecting suggestions he or his staff overstepped in their numerous conversations with Wilson-Raybould about their view that an engineering company facing bribery and fraud charges should not be prosecuted. 
On Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould highlighted the extent to which she alleges the prime minister’s closest aides “hounded” her in order to secure a politically beneficial outcome for the party – and Trudeau himself. 
Wilson-Raybould, the first indigenous minister of justice and attorney general in Canadian history, had described a sustained effort by government officials to influence her judgment. Nearly four months after she said the pressure began, she was removed from her job as the country’s top prosecutor – and instead was named minister of veterans affairs. She has repeatedly said she will run again in the federal election as a Liberal party candidate, a move experts view as difficult given her public spat with the prime minister. 
Her characterization of Trudeau’s conduct – and of his aides’ behaviour – is particularly troubling for the Trudeau administration, given the recent controversy over the detention of the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. Trudeau had repeatedly said that Canada’s justice system is immune from political interference amid calls by the Chinese for her release. 
On Thursday, Trudeau reaffirmed his belief that all discussions over the matter were proper. 
“I totally disagree with the former attorney general’s characterization [of discussions] in her testimony,” said Trudeau. He denied Wilson-Raybould was removed as attorney general for her refusal to back down. 
Political rivals jumped on Wilson-Raybould’s testimony. Opposition leader Andrew Scheer of the Conservative party said Trudeau had “lost the moral authority to govern” and called for his resignation. Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic party, said the prime minister was not on the side of Canadians but stopped short of calling for his resignation.

The scandal first began 7 February, after the Globe and Mail reported the prime minister’s office had improperly pressured Wilson-Raybould to abandon the prosecution of a large engineering company, SNC Lavalin, for fraud and bribery. 
The Quebec engineering giant SNC Lavalin, which paid C$48m (US$36.5m) in bribes to Muammar Gaddafi’s regime in Libya between 2001 to 2011, is lobbying for a remedy known as a deferred prosecution agreement instead of a trial and criminal prosecution. But federal prosecutors are uninterested in pursuing an agreement – a reality Trudeau’s inner circle had struggled to change. 
Wilson-Raybould’s testimony marked the first instance in which the prime minister was directly implicated in efforts to dissuade her from pursuing prosecution. 
“Are you politically interfering with my role as attorney general? I would strongly advise against it,” Wilson-Raybould recalled telling the prime minister, after he reminded her he was a member of parliament from Quebec – and asked her to “help out” in the case. 
“No, no, no, we just need to find a solution,” she said was the prime minister’s answer. 
On 12 February, Wilson-Raybould resigned. The country’s ethics commissioner is currently investigating the accusations.  
Drawing on text messages and contemporaneous memos, she described 10 meeting and 10 telephone calls over the issue, which began in mid September of 218. Wilson-Raybould also testified about the extent of the pressure she faced, including aides promising a flurry of positive op-eds in Canadian papers to provide her political cover if she backed down. The efforts–and threats to undermine her position evoked “thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre”, the infamous resignations of high-ranking US justice department officials during the Watergate investigations. 
While the scandal has damaged the prime minister’s image of transparency and openness, damage appears to be minimal in Quebec, where support for SNC Lavalin is strong, given the 3,400 people it employs in the province. 
Wilson-Raybould’s testimony marked the first time she has spoken at length about the pressure on her office. Questions still remain about the content of her discussions with the prime minister, which are protected by solicitor-client privilege.",2019-02-28 19:26:16+01:00

Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is facing the biggest political scandal of his administration. The affair centres around allegations that his former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, was improperly pressured by some of his closest advisers to prevent the prosecution of a large Canadian engineering firm over accusations of fraud and bribery. Thus far, the scandal has been politically costly; Gerald Butts, a longtime friend of Trudeau’s, and his closest adviser, resigned two weeks ago. Wilson-Raybould had quit a week earlier, within hours of the prime minister denying she was unhappy. A handful of polls are showing the scandal is politically unpopular for the governing Liberals – which is worrying for them, given there is a federal election in October. 
What is the company accused of? 
SNC-Lavalin, based in Montreal, is accused of paying C$48m worth of bribes in Libya to Muammar Gaddafi’s family, in order to secure lucrative contracts. The bribery is alleged to have occurred between 2001 and 2011. If found guilty, the company would be barred from bidding on federal projects for a decade. SNC-Lavalin employs nearly 50,000 people worldwide, with 3,400 in Quebec.

Company executives have been lobbying for a “deferred prosecution agreement”, which in effect allows them to pay a fine in lieu of a criminal prosecution, with no ban on bidding for contracts. But federal prosectors have decided to pursue a trial. 
This is where the scandal is centred: the prime minister and his aides, along with the finance minister, have been accused of pressing Wilson-Raybould to intervene and asking prosecutors to accept a deferred prosecution agreement. Wilson-Raybould declined to override the judgment of her top legal team. 
What does the former attorney general say? 
In searing testimony in front of parliament’s justice committee, Wilson-Raybould detailed “consistent and sustained” efforts to change her mind. Despite repeated assertions by Wilson-Raybould that she would not bend, she told a justice committee on Wednesday the pressure intensified – and included “veiled threats” by aides that she was on course for a clash with the prime minister. She said that while it was proper for ministers and their staff to consult her about protecting jobs, it was inappropriate for her to make decisions based on “partisan political considerations”. Her testimony also marked the first public assertion that Trudeau lobbied her – to the point that she felt obliged to warn him what he was asking was improper. 
She also told parliamentarians she suspected her refusal to back down lay behind her move to the Veterans’ Affairs portfolio in a mid-January cabinet reshuffle.  
What does Trudeau say? 
Trudeau has not denied that he and his team spoke to Wilson-Raybould and her staff about SNC-Lavalin. He says all of their discussions were respectful and within the bounds of the rules. On Thursday, he reiterated his belief that as prime minister, it is his job and duty to protect the jobs of Canadians – likely a reference to the potential for job losses in the event of a conviction.  
Is it a big deal? 
The leader of the opposition, Andrew Scheer, has called on Trudeau to resign –something Trudeau has rejected. Other political leaders have called for more investigations into the affair – and the country’s ethics commissioner is investigating. But at the justice committee hearing on Wednesday, members of Trudeau’s Liberal party appeared as unified; there have been no high-profile shows of public support for Wilson-Raybould within the party since Wednesday. 
What is local media saying?

On Thursday, Wilson-Raybould’s testimony was on the front page of every major paper in the country, with most running large, dramatic photos of the defiant former attorney general. “I Said ‘No’, My Mind Had Been Made Up,” said the National Post. “Wilson-Raybould Speaks Her Truth,” said the Toronto Star. “Wilson-Raybould points accusing finger at PM,” said the Vancouver Sun. And the Globe and Mail, which broke the story, ran with the headline: “An effort to politically interfere.” 
What happens next? 
A number of figures have requested to testify before the justice committee, including Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s former adviser and Michael Wernick, the country’s top public servant. Both were present in many of the discussions – and both have publicly stated previously they did nothing wrong. The prime minister has also said he would consider the future of Wilson-Raybould in the party. While the scandal will likely not damage him in Quebec, where his support of SNC-Lavalin is viewed positively, it could prove damaging in the rest of the country.

He said: “There are conversations that were experienced differently. I regret that.” The firm, which employs 9,000 people in Canada, is based in the province of Québec, where Trudeau’s Liberals need to pick up seats to win a federal election set for October. The scandal has cast a shadow over Trudeau’s domestic image as someone who is committed to transparent government. His conciliatory remarks in front of reporters on Thursday were an attempt to shift public attention away from the scandal. “He’s trying to strike a kind of tone that is reasonable, acknowledging that this could been handled better,” said Lori Turnbull, a professor of political science at Dalhousie University. “[He’s saying] essentially this is a communications issue. This is a political competence issue at worse, but this is not a corruption issue and nobody pushed anybody around.” But the prime minister’s statement did little to placate political rivals. “What we heard from Justin Trudeau was an attempt to justify and normalise corruption. It’s clearer than ever that, inside his government, political interference and contempt for the rule of law are a matter of course,” tweeted the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer. “This is a PM who has lost the moral authority to govern.” Jagmeet Singh, leader of the leftwing New Democratic party, repeated calls for a full public inquiry into the issue. Trudeau said he had made mistakes and acknowledged an “erosion of trust” between his office and Wilson-Raybould, who was removed from her post as attorney general in January and resigned from the cabinet in mid-February. He denied that his involvement in the case was for partisan or political reasons – but admitted he asked Wilson-Raybould to “revisit her decision” after she told the prime minister’s office it was her intention to proceed with prosecution of the company. His comments also marked the first time the prime minister had directly spoken about the allegations, following the testimony of Wilson-Raybould and the surprise resignation of the Treasury Board president, Jane Philpott, who said she no longer had confidence in the government. Trudeau indicated the two were likely to remain part of the Liberal caucus, despite their public repudiation of the prime minister’s handling of the scandal. Trudeau, typically eager to speak with reporters, cancelled media availability at two events, instead returning to Ottawa for private meetings on how to navigate the troubles facing his government. Gerald Butts, the former principal secretary to the prime minister, testified in front of the parliamentary justice committee on Wednesday and rejected the idea that anyone within Trudeau’s office pressured the attorney general – suggesting he and Wilson-Raybould had divergent interpretations of the same events. Butts, a close friend of Trudeau, resigned from his post shortly after Wilson-Raybould exited cabinet. On Thursday, the prime minister confirmed that SNC-Lavalin’s presence in Québec would be in jeopardy if the government secured a conviction, which would bar it from bidding for federal contracts for a decade. While the government is eager to move forward from the crisis, Wilson-Raybould has expressed interest in returning to the justice committee to further testify – a move the Liberals on the committee have so far blocked. In a statement to media on Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould said  her testimony “was not a complete account but only a detailed summary” and said she looked forward to giving a fuller picture of the events that led to the current political crisis.",2019-03-07 17:57:50+01:00
