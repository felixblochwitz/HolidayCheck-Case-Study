The allegation has dominated political discussion in Canada in recent days after it was highlighted by a blogger last month. At the time, Trudeau was a 28-year-old teacher and had been attending a music festival sponsored by a beer company in British Columbia. The festival was raising money to support avalanche safety, a cause Trudeau had become involved with after his brother Michel died in an avalanche in 1998.   Related: Trump, Twitter and the art of constructive disagreement    Days after the event, an unsigned editorial appeared in the Creston Valley Advance, a local newspaper, accusing Trudeau of “groping” and “inappropriately handling” an unnamed female reporter who was covering the event. While the editorial offered no specifics on what had happened, it claimed the woman felt “blatantly disrespected” and Trudeau had apologised for his behaviour. “I’m sorry,” the editorial alleged Trudeau to have said. “If I had known you were reporting for a national paper, I never would have been so forward.” On Sunday, Trudeau was asked about the allegations for the first time since becoming Canadian prime minister. “I remember that day in Creston well,” he told reporters. “I had a good day that day. I don’t remember any negative interactions that day at all.” The reporter behind the allegations has not responded to interview requests from the Guardian. The then publisher of the newspaper told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) she remembered the reporter being “distressed” after her interaction with Trudeau. “My recollections of the conversation were that she came to me because she was unsettled by it,” said Valerie Bourne. Bourne believed the reporter was talking to Trudeau when he touched her. “It was a brief touch,” she said. “I would not classify it or qualify it as sexual assault.” The editorial was likely written by the reporter, Bourne suggested. “She didn’t like what had happened. She wasn’t sure how she should proceed with it, because of course we’re talking [about] somebody who was known to the Canadian community,” she said. The paper’s then editor, Brian Bell, said he believed the reporter’s account. “I don’t recall that the reporter was coming across as having been traumatised or distraught about it, but definitely that whatever physical touch or whatever had occurred in that moment was definitely not welcome and definitely inappropriate,” he told the CBC. “I certainly believe that it happened; this reporter was of a high character in my opinion and was professional in the way she conducted herself, and there’s no question in my mind that what was alluded to, written about in that editorial, did happen.” Trudeau’s comments on Sunday echoed a statement his office made last month that he “doesn’t think he had any negative interactions” at the music festival.",2018-07-02 14:23:19+02:00
world/2018/jul/03/doug-ford-scraps-carbon-tax-plan-and-sets-up-climate-fight-with-trudeau,article,world,World news,2018-07-03 20:11:03+00:00,Doug Ford scraps carbon tax plan and sets up climate fight with Trudeau,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/doug-ford-scraps-carbon-tax-plan-and-sets-up-climate-fight-with-trudeau,"Ontario’s new rightwing government has ended a carbon pricing policy aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Canada’s most populous province.  The move to scrap the cap-and-trade program puts the provincial Conservative government – led by Doug Ford – directly at odds with the federal government’s bid to ensure provinces have a price on carbon in place by the end of 2018.    Related: Canada's largest national park risks losing world heritage status    Days after he was sworn in as premier, Ford – the brother of former Toronto mayor Rob Ford – expressed his opposition to the idea. “Cap-and-trade and carbon tax schemes are no more than government cash grabs that do nothing for the environment, while hitting people in the wallet in order to fund big government programs,” Ford said in a statement.  Ending the program will help Ford deliver on a campaign promise to reduce gasoline prices by 10 cents per litre. “Cancelling the cap-and-trade carbon tax will result in lower prices at the gas pump, on your home heating bills and on virtually every other product that you buy,” Ford added. In the leadup to last month’s Ontario election, Ford – who has elicited comparisons to Donald Trump – explained in a televised debate that while he believed in man-made global warming, he does not believe in “putting an artificial tax called the carbon tax, the cap-and-trade, that does absolutely nothing to help the environment”. He continued: “The carbon tax is the single worst tax anyone – not just in Ontario – Canada could ever have.”  In place since 2017, the policy limits greenhouse gas emissions for large companies, allowing those who are below or above the threshold to sell, buy or trade credits in a carbon market that includes Quebec and California. The decision to end the program puts Ontario, home to a third of Canada’s population and the country’s economic engine, in line for a climate showdown with the federal government, led by Justin Trudeau.  Shortly after Ford’s election, Canada’s minister of environment and climate change, Catherine McKenna, said in a statement that her government would consider imposing carbon pricing on the province if Ford carried through on his promise to scrap cap-and-trade.  On Tuesday, a spokesperson for the minister said work would continue to tackle climate change. “By cancelling Ontario’s cap-and-trade plan, the premier is making it clear that he is not interested in taking climate action, and is effectively withdrawing from Canada’s national climate change plan.”  Ford’s government has earmarked C$30m to fight Ottawa in court over the issue. The move could prove to be a costly one for the new Conservative government, said Keith Brooks of Environmental Defence. The economic impact will be felt across sectors as the program helped fuel demand for energy efficiency and propel Ontario’s clean tech sector into the largest and fastest-growing in the country.

Mike Schreiner – who made history last month after he was elected as Ontario’s first provincial parliamentarian from the Green party – slammed the government’s decision, calling it “reckless and irresponsible”, in a statement. “Ontario can address the climate crisis in a way that creates jobs, benefits our economy and leaves a livable planet for our kids and grandkids,” he added. “Instead, Premier Ford is gambling with our future.”",2018-07-03 22:11:03+02:00

The accusation first appeared in a local newspaper a few days after a music festival in British Columbia that Trudeau, then a 28-year-old teacher, was attending.

The unsigned editorial in the Creston Valley Advance accused Trudeau of “groping” and “inappropriately handling” an unnamed reporter who was covering the event. 
While the editorial offered no specifics on what had happened, it claimed the reporter felt “blatantly disrespected” and Trudeau had apologised for his behaviour. “I’m sorry,” the editorial alleged Trudeau to have said. “If I had known you were reporting for a national paper, I never would have been so forward.” 
The festival had raised thousands of dollars to support avalanche safety, a cause Trudeau had become involved with after his brother Michel died in an avalanche in 1998. 
The allegation has dominated political discussion in Canada in recent days after it was highlighted by a political commentator last month. 
The reporter behind the allegation – who is also believed to be the author of the editorial – has not responded to interview requests from the Guardian. 
Trudeau addressed the allegation briefly on Monday, describing the day of the event as a “good day” and one in which he did not recall any “negative interactions”.After calls for an independent investigation into the claim and opposition criticism of his initial response, Trudeau addressed the issue at length on Thursday. 
“I’ve been reflecting very carefully on what I remember from that incident almost 20 years ago,” he told reporters. “I do not feel that I acted inappropriately in any way. But I respect the fact that someone else might have experienced that differently.”  
When asked about why he had apologised to the woman after the alleged incident, Trudeau said: “If I apologised later, it would be because I sensed that she was not entirely comfortable with the interaction that we had.”  
Pressed further, he acknowledged he had atoned for his actions at the time. “I apologised in the moment,” he said, without giving details.  
Trudeau said he had not attempted to contact the woman, nor had anyone from his team. “We don’t think that would be appropriate at all.” 
He said the issues surrounding sexual assault and other behaviours had been something he had been actively engaged in since his early 20s. He characterised the allegation against him as part of an “awakening” currently taking place in society. 
“I don’t want to speak for her, I don’t want to presume how she feels now,” Trudeau said. “I’m responsible for my side of the interaction, which certainly – as I said – I don’t feel was in anyway untoward.”  
He continued: “But at the same time, this lesson that we are learning – and I’ll be blunt about it – often a man experiences an interaction as being benign, or not inappropriate, and a woman, particularly in a professional context can experience it differently. And we have to respect that, and reflect on it.”",2018-07-06 12:29:49+02:00

On Friday – a day after the Canadian prime minister acknowledged he had apologised to her – the woman, identified as Rose Knight, issued a statement saying that she was “reluctantly” addressing the issue in the face of mounting media pressure. 
Knight offered no additional details on what had happened. “The incident referred to in the editorial did occur, as reported,” she said. “Mr Trudeau did apologise the next day.”

At the time of the allegation, Trudeau was a 28-year-old teacher. The festival had raised thousands of dollars to support avalanche safety, a cause Trudeau had become involved with after his brother Michel died in an avalanche in 1998. 
Days after the event, an unsigned editorial appeared in the Creston Valley Advance, a local newspaper, accusing Trudeau of “groping” and “inappropriately handling” an unnamed female reporter who was covering the event.

The editorial read: “But shouldn’t the son of a former prime minister be aware of the rights and wrongs that go along with public socializing? Didn’t he learn, through his vast experiences in public life, that groping a strange young woman isn’t in the handbook of proper etiquette, regardless of who she is, what her business is or where they are?” 
The accusation has dominated Canada’s political conversation after it was highlighted by a political commentator last month. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
After initially telling reporters that he did not remember any “negative interactions” on the day of the event, Trudeau conceded on Thursday that he had apologised to the woman at the time. “I do not feel that I acted inappropriately in any way,” he told reporters. “But I respect the fact that someone else might have experienced that differently.” 
In her statement, Knight said she had not had any subsequent contact with Trudeau, either before or after he became prime minister. “I did not pursue the incident at the time and will not be pursuing the incident further.” 
The former reporter said that she had initially avoided speaking out in order to protect her and her family’s privacy and noted that she did not intend to issue any further statements or grant interviews. “The debate, if it continues, will continue without my involvement,” she said.",2018-07-07 00:55:03+02:00
