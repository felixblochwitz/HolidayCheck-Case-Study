A photograph of Trudeau with brown makeup on his face, neck and hands and dressed in a turban and robes was published by Time magazine on Wednesday. It appeared in a school yearbook, while Trudeau, then 29, was working as a teacher at West Point Grey Academy.

“I apologise profoundly,” said the Canadian prime minister on Wednesday night after the photograph was published. “I regret it deeply. I’m deeply sorry I did that, I should have known better.”

“It was something I should not have done. I didn’t think it was racist at the time, but now I see, it was a racist thing to do.” 
Trudeau did not answer a question about whether he had considered resigning. 
“In 2001, when I was a teacher in Vancouver, I attended an end-of-year gala, the theme was Arabian nights. I dressed up in an Aladdin costume and put makeup on. I shouldn’t have done it. I should have known better, but I didn’t and I’m really sorry,” Trudeau said. 
Political rivals seized on the opportunity to attack the prime minister, issuing scathing condemnations following revelations of the damning image. 
Andrew Scheer, the Conservative leader and Trudeau’s main opponent, said he was “extremely shocked and disappointed” at the actions of the prime minister, calling his rival “unfit” to lead Canada. “It was racist in 2001, it’s racist now,” he said.

Scheer has consistently used the prime minister’s ethical lapses to paint the government as unable to govern effectively. But the Conservative leader has also faced calls to eject his own party members for racist or homophobic statements in recent weeks. He told reporters he would stand by candidates who showed genuine remorse for previous actions. 
After issuing an initial condemnation of the image, Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic party, released a second video, in which he emotionally described the racism he and many others faced growing up in Canada. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
“Seeing this image today – the kids that see this image the people who see this image – are going to think about all the times in their life that they were made fun of, that they were hurt…that they were insulted, that they were made to feel less, because of who they are,” said Singh, the first non-white leader of a major federal party. 
“Please reach out to loved ones. Please reach out to people who are suffering in silence right now. Please let them know they are loved. And they are celebrated for who they are.” 
The Green party leader, Elizabeth May, said she was “deeply shocked by the racism shown in this photograph of Justin Trudeau”. 
“He must apologize for the harm done and commit to learning and appreciating the requirement to model social justice leadership at all levels of government,” she said in a statement. “In this matter he has failed.” 
The National Council of Canadian Muslims said his appearance in brownface was “disgraceful”, but later thanked the prime minister for apologizing. 
In his apology, the prime minister also confirmed that this was not the first time he had done something like this, saying that when he was in high school he dressed up at a talent show and sang Day O, a traditional Jamaican folk song, “with makeup on”. 
“Obviously I regret that I did it,” he said. “I’m pissed off at myself, obviously.” 
He told reporters he had made numerous calls to friends and colleagues – and expected to make more on Thursday. 
The incident comes as Trudeau is locked in a fight to maintain his parliamentary majority. Canadians vote on 21 October, in what many expect to be a tight race. 
Polling suggests Trudeau and Scheer are deadlocked in the popular vote, but that the Liberals hold an edge when it comes to winning seats in parliament. 
The election will be fought against the backdrop of a protracted political scandal for the incumbent prime minister, with accusations – including from the country’s ethics commissioner – that Trudeau acted improperly when he requested his attorney general to halt criminal prosecution of the Quebec-based engineering giant SNC Lavalin. 
After his election in 2015, Trudeau was hailed for naming a young and ethnically-diverse cabinet, with a ministerial team that for the first time in the country’s history was equally balanced between men and women. 
His cabinet included Maryam Monsef, who fled Afghanistan as a refugee 20 years ago and will oversee the democratic reform portfolio, as well as two Indigenous members of parliament and three Sikh politicians. 
“It’s important to be here before you today to present to Canada a cabinet that looks like Canada,” Trudeau said after he was sworn in. 
However, the Canadian leader has also been criticised for his treatment of Indigenous peoples, particularly in relation to the Trans Mountain pipeline project that the Liberal government has supported despite environmental and Indigenous groups fiercely opposing the project. 
It is unclear how the image will impact the prime minister, who has cultivated a tightly-controlled social media image. When asked by reporters if he would eject a member of his own party for a similar image, he said he wouldn’t entertain “hypotheticals” and that each incident would be viewed on a “case-by-case basis”. 
When asked why he should stay on as leader, Trudeau responded: “I’m asking Canadians to forgive me for what I did.”",2019-09-19 04:29:35+02:00

Good morning briefers. I’m Martin Farrer and I’m bringing you the top news stories this morning from home and abroad. 
Justin Trudeau has apologised after a photograph emerged of him wearing brownface makeup at a fancy dress party when he was a young teacher. The Canadian prime minister said he “deeply regrets” the incident at the school in Vancouver in 2001. “It was something I should not have done,” he said. “I didn’t think it was racist at the time, but now I see, it was a racist thing to do.” He also admitted to doing the same on another occasion to sing the Harry Belafonte song, Day O. “Obviously I regret that I did it,” he said. “I’m pissed off at myself, obviously.” He told reporters he had made numerous calls to friends and colleagues – and expected to make more on Thursday. 
The timing of the picture’s release by Time magazine comes as Trudeau seeks reelection next month in what was already a very tight race. His conservative opponent, Andrew Scheer, has consistently used the prime minister’s ethical lapses to attack Trudeau and he seized on the blackface picture, saying his rival was “unfit to govern”.

Royal eyebrow – David Cameron has admitted that he sought the Queen’s intervention when polls showed that Scottish nationalists might win the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. The former prime minister says in the BBC’s The Cameron Years documentary next week that he had not asked for anything improper, “just a raising of the eyebrow, even you know a quarter of an inch, we thought would make a difference”. Shortly afterwards, the Queen was reported as telling churchgoers near Balmoral that people should “think carefully” about voting to split from the UK.

‘An emergency’ – A majority of the public believe the climate crisis is the gravest problem facing the world and that politicians are not doing enough to tackle it, according to a survey carried out in eight countries. As millions of people around the world prepare to flock to what are expected to be the biggest climate protests ever seen tomorrow, the survey shows that the climate breakdown is ranked above migration, terrorism and the global economy in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Brazil and Canada. Only in the US does it not have top billing, coming in behind terrorism and affordable healthcare. It comes as the teenage activist, Greta Thunberg, urged US Congress to “listen to the scientists” and take some action.

Brexit catchup 
&gt; The EU has given Boris Johnson two weeks to formulate a plan to overcome the Irish backstop problem or “it’s over”. Although it is still not clear what the backstop solution might be, we were given a clue of sorts when it emerged that Johnson, on his chaotic visit to Luxembourg on Monday, had allegedly been surprised at how many border checks would be needed in Ireland. Add that to the homework list. 
&gt; Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster indicated yesterday that she might accept a bespoke border solution for Northern Ireland to overcome the backstop problem. Her party has previously resisted having different rules from the rest of the UK. 
&gt; There was a neat soundbite at the second day of the supreme court hearing into the prorogation of parliament. Aidan O’Neill QC, a Scottish advocate opposed to the suspension, said Johnson’s government is unworthy of trust because it conspired to ensure that “the mother of parliaments” was closed down by “the father of lies”. It’s the last day of the hearings today. 
&gt; Labour MPs and activists are set for their own Brexit battle at next week’s conference in Brighton. Many are unhappy about Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to try to stay neutral on the issue in any election campaign and want the party to commit to a remain stance. The party is also reportedly going to review the language of Tony Blair’s landmark Clause IV reforms next week.

The last harrumph – Mornings will never be the same again when rottweiler-in-chief John Humphrys steps down from the Today programme after an epic 32-year stint. Colleagues share their memories of the presenter whose gladiatorial style has earned him as many brickbats as plaudits, but who has defined an era of more confrontational journalism. James Naughtie says working with Humphrys was “never dull and always exhilarating” while former Radio 4 controller Mark Damazer says the 76-year-old’s “fearlessness” had been “of incalculable value”. And finally, here are some of harrumphing Humph’s famous highs and lows.

China’s Loch Ness monster? – There was great excitement in China this week after pictures circulated on social media showing what appeared to be some sort of giant sea creature in the Yangtze river. There was speculation that a Loch Ness-style monster could have been spawned by pollution in the giant waterway. But, alas, the reality is more prosaic after it was established that the “creature – dubbed the Three Gorges Water Monster” – was actually a 20m-long industrial airbag.

Lunchtime read: Turbot? Okra? What’s your least favourite food? 
 
  
 
Despite the explosion in exotic dishes and ingredients available at British restaurants in recent years, it seems there are some that not even our leading chefs like that much. We’ve spoken to some of them and gleaned an idea of how people on the other side of the kitchen divide feel about globe artichoke (“faffy”), turbot (“that mucus is absolutely disgusting”) and even coriander (“it gets everywhere”). For Jason Atherton, chef-proprietor of the Social Company restaurants, okra is the worst of the lot. “Okra is the most foul thing ever grown,” he says. “I refuse to work with it. If I see it in a dish, I ask for it to be removed.” 
Sport 
Mauricio Pochettino accused his Tottenham players of lacking fight in the 2-2 Champions League draw at Olympiakos and suggested that they needed to work harder on the psychological side of their game. Ilkay Gündogan scored the pick of the goals as Manchester City eased to a 3-0 away victory over Shakhtar Donetsk, while Ángel Di María scored twice against his former club and Gareth Bale had a goal ruled out by VAR as Paris St-Germain beat Real Madrid 3-0. Wales have a readymade replacement for Rob Howley, who has left Japan after a suspected breach of World Rugby’s betting regulations, but pre-World Cup upheaval rarely bodes well, writes Paul Rees. The culture secretary has called for top women’s sport to be added to televised sport’s “crown jewels” list, which would guarantee them exposure to potentially mass audiences on free-to-air television that men’s tournaments currently enjoy. And the death of Fernando Ricksen, the former Rangers and Netherlands player, has brought to a close a six-year battle with motor neurone disease. 
Business 
Asian markets have edged higher after the decision by the US Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate by 0.25%. The widely expected move was largely priced in by investors. The FTSE100 is seen opening down this morning while the pound is buying £1.248 and €1.130. 
The papers 
 
  
 
The Express leads with “EU demands: show Brexit plan in 12 days or ‘it’s over’”, the Telegraph says “Rees-Mogg urges Farage supporters to return to the Tory fold” and the Times reports on debates around Labour’s constitution: “Labour starts to reverse Blair’s Clause 4 reforms”. 
The Guardian has: “Saudis to Trump: here’s our proof – now world must respond to Iran”, while the FT says: “Fed rate cut follows second bid to ease overnight lending squeeze”. The Mirror claims the murders of four women resemble the killings committed by Christopher Halliwell: “Confession killer: ‘4 more victims’” and the Sun has: “Loch yes monster!”, reporting that a huge “eel-like creature” has been filmed which the paper says experts believe “really is the monster”. 
The i leads with a story that there has been a surge of HIV tests after former rugby star Gareth Thomas went public with his condition: “‘Have the courage to speak out. Don’t be afraid’”, the paper quotes him as saying.

Climate ‘seen as most important political issue’ by public 
The climate campaigner Greta Thunberg has urged US lawmakers to “listen to the scientists” as she joined other young activists in testifying before Congress on Thursday, before Friday’s global climate strikes and the UN climate summit in New York. The Swedish teenager told the hearing she had prepared no remarks of her own, and instead submitted last year’s landmark IPCC report, which warned of an imminent climate catastrophe. 
 
 Global poll. A majority of the public in eight countries including the US and UK sees the climate crisis as the most pressing political issue of the day, ahead of migration or terrorism, according to a poll. 
 Halving emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions could be halved by 2030 if a small number of trends and renewable energy technologies are adopted more widely, according to a report by an international group of experts. 
 
Trudeau apologises after brownface photo emerges 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
The Canadian prime minister has apologised for wearing brownface to a party when he was a teacher in 2001, admitting “it was a racist thing to do”. A photograph of the then-29-year-old Justin Trudeau, dressed as Aladdin for an Arabian Nights-themed gala at a private school in Vancouver, originally appeared in a school yearbook and was republished this week by Time magazine. “I regret it deeply. I’m deeply sorry I did that, I should have known better,” he said. 
 
 Election campaign. The controversy could prove a turning point for Canada’s general election campaign, in which Trudeau is battling for his political life. His main opponent, the Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, said the photo proved Trudeau was “unfit” to lead Canada.

Donald Trump made a promise to a foreign leader in a phone call that so troubled a US intelligence official that they filed a whistleblower complaint deemed of “urgent concern”, according to a report by the Washington Post. The newspaper did not identify the official, the foreign leader nor the president’s alleged pledge. But the complaint was considered sufficiently pressing by the intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, to be shared with congressional oversight committees. 
 
 Intelligence committee. However, the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, refused to share details about the complaint with lawmakers, the Post reported. He and Atkinson are due to discuss the matter with the House intelligence committee.

An investigation by the Guardian in partnership with the news website Sludge has revealed millions of dollars of investments by US senators in sectors on which they set policy. The analysis of recent personal financial disclosure data found that 51 senators and their spouses have up to $96m personally invested in corporate stocks in defense, communications, health, finance, real estate and energy, which together represent a staggering conflict of interest. 
 
 Banking investments. Senators have investments in more than 300 firms, including Apple, ExxonMobil, Verizon and Boeing. Ten members of the Senate banking committee, including Republicans and Democrats, are personally invested in the financial companies they oversee.

Top stories More than 250 Australian academics have publicly backed school climate strikes around the country, telling schoolchildren civil disobedience is required to “defend life itself” in the face of political inaction. Tens of thousands are expected to march at more than 100 locations across Australia today, with professors and researchers writing that it is “unconscionable” that current and future generations will have to bear the “terrifying brunt of this unprecedented disaster”. “When a government wilfully abrogates its responsibility to protect its citizens from harm and secure the future for generations to come, it has failed in its most essential duty of stewardship,” the open letter states. Follow coverage of the strikes throughout the day on our live blog, from 8.15am AEST. A third blackface incident involving Justin Trudeau has been revealed, just hours after the Canadian prime minister apologised “profoundly” for wearing what he described as “racist” makeup to a costume party in 2001. The latest images came in a short, undated video clip published by Global News in which Trudeau – his face, arms and legs painted black – waves at the camera and sticks out his tongue. The opposition Conservative party – now neck-and-neck with Trudeau’s Liberals with an election weeks away – confirmed it had sent the video to Global News. The immigration services provider Serco has been awarded a tender worth nearly $10m by the Australian government to return non-citizens to their home countries, despite the UN already providing such a service. Costing $415,000 a month for the next two years, Serco’s assisted returns program has drawn criticism from refugee advocates, given historic allegations of mistreatment during the company’s management of offshore detention centres.

But is there more to the artist known as Kaws than just a pop culture craze, asks Steph Harmon. “The figures are often talked about as cartoon or fun or whatever … but I think he’s responding very clearly to the rise of loneliness in our society,” says the curator Simon Maidment, as the National Gallery of Victoria launches a 25-year retrospective, including more than 100 works by the artist.

While albums were released in the 1950s and 60s at the same breakneck pace as singles, driven in part by the immense commercial success of bands like the Beatles, by the 70s the rise of the LP changed “how we perceive and remember what was once the most evanescent of the arts”, according to the famed critic Robert Christgau.

world/2019/sep/19/justin-trudeau-wearing-blackface-details-emerge-third-incident,article,world,World news,2019-09-20 06:45:48+00:00,Trudeau says he can't recall how many times he wore blackface makeup,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/19/justin-trudeau-wearing-blackface-details-emerge-third-incident,"Justin Trudeau is scrambling to halt further damage to his re-election campaign after a string of racist images from his past put Canada’s image-conscious prime minister at the centre of yet another scandal. 
Less than five weeks before the federal election on 21 October, the Liberal leader’s campaign was rocked when images emerged of Trudeau wearing blackface makeup. 
On Thursday, new video emerged of a third instance of Trudeau in blackface – just hours after he had apologized for wearing what he described as “racist” makeup to a costume party in 2001. 
The latest images came in a short, undated video clip published by Global News in which, Trudeau – his face, arms and legs painted black – waves at the camera and sticks his tongue out. The opposition Conservative party – currently neck-and-neck with Trudeau’s Liberals – confirmed it had sent the video to Global News earlier in the week. 
Trudeau admitted he could not remember how often he had worn blackface makeup. “I am wary of being definitive about this because of the recent pictures that came out, I had not remembered,” he told reporters in Winnipeg. A spokesman for the prime minister said he had spent the morning calling Liberal candidates and community leaders to fully apologize for what he did “knowing how racist and hurtful this type of thing was”.

The scandal erupted late on Wednesday, when Time magazine published an image of Trudeau dressed as Aladdin – complete with dark skin makeup and a turban – at a 2001 function at a private school where he was then working as a 29-year-old teacher. 
Trudeau immediately apologized, and acknowledged that he had previously blacked up at a high school talent show, when he had sung Day-O, the traditional Jamaican song. 
“I apologise profoundly,” Trudeau told reporters aboard his campaign plane. “I didn’t think it was racist at the time, but now I see, it was a racist thing to do. 
“I’m pissed off at myself. I’m disappointed in myself,” he said.

Opposition politicians reacted swiftly, saying the decades-old images called into question Trudeau’s judgment, his commitment to diversity – and his fitness to lead the country.

“How do you look someone in the eye that has mocked the lived reality that I have lived – but, more importantly, what a lot of Canadians have lived,” said Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic party. 
The Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer – Trudeau’s main opponent – said he was “shocked and disappointed” and claimed the prime minister had “lied” in his apology to Canadians. 
But Scheer has also faced calls in recent weeks to eject members from within his own party for racist or homophobic statements. He told reporters he would stand by candidates who showed genuine remorse for previous actions – a standard he appeared unprepared to offer to Trudeau. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
The Green party leader, Elizabeth May, said she was “deeply shocked by the racism shown in this photograph of Justin Trudeau”, saying the prime minister must commit to learning better social justice leadership at “all levels of government”. 
Greg Fergus, a Liberal MP in Quebec and member of the federal Black Caucus, said he was “hopeful” the incident could help spur “nuanced” conversations about systemic racism in Canada. 
“I think the real measure of the man, and I think the thing we need to be talking about, is all the amazing things we have done for diversity,” Fergus said. 
“What Justin Trudeau did was wrong. He has apologized. I know it is not representative of the man he is,” Mitzie Hunter, a black member of Ontario’s Liberal party, tweeted. “This is a teachable moment for all of us. I accept his apology and I hope Canadians do too.”

Others, were less forgiving of the prime minister’s previous actions. 
“The privilege continues. There is no excuse for this. Apology is a first step. You should be aware of the history of #blackface and racism in this country and others. Apparently #diversityisourstrength? Deeply disappointed,” tweeted former colleague Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who left the Liberal party in March 2019. 
After his landslide electoral victory in 2015, Trudeau was praised for his apparent commitment to diversity and inclusion, as well as polices which appeared to offer an explicit rebuke to those of Donald Trump: he quickly named a young and ethnically diverse cabinet and initially welcome large numbers of Syrian refugees. 
But he is fighting for his second parliamentary majority against the backdrop of a protracted political scandal: earlier this year Canada’s ethics watchdog found that Trudeau broke the country’s conflict of interest law when he allegedly pressured his attorney general to halt the criminal prosecution of the Quebec-based engineering giant SNC Lavalin. 
Trudeau’s Liberal is effectively locked in a dead heat with rival Conservatives in terms of the popular vote, but they hold an edge when it comes to winning seats in parliament. 
It remains unclear how the images will affect the prime minister, whose political career has benefited as much from his carefully curated public persona as from his policies. 
When asked by reporters if he would eject a member of his own party for a similar image, he said he wouldn’t entertain “hypotheticals” and that each incident would be viewed on a “case-by-case basis”. 
Asked why he should stay on as leader, Trudeau responded: “I’m asking Canadians to forgive me for what I did.”",2019-09-20 08:45:48+02:00

Greta Thunberg and school students lead worldwide protest 
Students and adults across America are joining a worldwide day of protest over the climate crisis on Friday, with strikes planned at more than 1,000 schools and workplaces in the US, the country’s largest ever mass climate demonstration. The global movement’s young figurehead, Greta Thunberg, will speak at a march in New York. The Guardian’s view: her message is simple and unignorable. In case you’re still not convinced, here is the climate crisis explained in 10 charts – and here’s how you can get involved. 
 
 Global health. The climate crisis is the biggest threat to global health over the next quarter-century, and governments are failing to prepare, according to a survey of the top medics who make up the membership of Britain’s Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. 
 Waterfront woes. New York City is taking action to protect the Lower Manhattan waterfront from the looming impact of climate change. But low-income residents who live by the water in other boroughs will have to fend for themselves, as Emily Nonko reports. 
 
US and Canada have lost one in four birds since 1970

The US and Canada have lost more than one in four of their birds – 3 billion animals in total – since 1970, a “widespread ecological crisis” outlined by scientists from both countries in a new study. The researchers observed a 29% decline in bird populations across diverse groups and habitats, from songbirds to long-distance migratory birds and backyard birds such as sparrows. Grassland birds suffered a staggering 53% reduction in population, while spring migration has fallen by 14% in the last decade alone. 
 
 Agriculture and urbanisation. The study, published in the journal Science, did not identify a specific reason for the decline, but bird populations and their habitats are thought to have been harmed by agriculture, urbanisation, climate change and cats. 
 
Whistleblower rumours focus on Ukraine amid Giuliani claims

A whistleblower complaint submitted by a US intelligence official, who was unusually troubled by a promise Donald Trump had made to a foreign leader in a phone call, was connected to Ukraine, according to reports in the Washington Post and New York Times. The foreign leader in question has not been identified, but the complaint was reportedly filed weeks before Trump spoke to the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. 
 
 Digging for dirt. Speaking to CNN on Thursday, the president’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, admitted asking Ukraine to investigate the former vice-president and 2020 presidential hopeful, Joe Biden, whose son once had a role in a Ukrainian gas company. 
 Iran rhetoric. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has dialled down the administration’s aggressive rhetoric in the wake of the recent attack on a Saudi oil facility, saying Washington wants a “peaceful resolution” with Iran, whom it blames for the attack. 
 
Trudeau ‘can’t recall’ how many times he wore blackface 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
Justin Trudeau has admitted he is “wary of being definitive” about the number of times he donned blackface as a young man, as the Canadian prime minister fights for his political life following the emergence of three separate, historical images of him wearing the racist makeup. The two photographs and a video all came out within 24 hours on Wednesday and Thursday, generating merciless criticism from rival party leaders less than five weeks before Canadians go to the polls on 21 October. 
 
 Political future. The blackface images have shattered Trudeau’s carefully curated image as a progressive leader, but the controversy may not shift the election needle as much as Canada’s Conservatives hope, as Leyland Cecco reports from Toronto.

world/2019/sep/20/justin-trudeau-canada-tries-to-shift-focus-from-blackface-images-to-gun-control,article,world,World news,2019-09-20 16:50:38+00:00,Trudeau tries to shift focus from brownface images to gun control,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/20/justin-trudeau-canada-tries-to-shift-focus-from-blackface-images-to-gun-control,"Justin Trudeau has tried to focus attention back on his re-election after a dramatic week in Canadian politics, in which the prime minister admitted to multiple images of him in brownface and not recalling how many times he had worn it. The embattled Trudeau spent Friday walking the streets of east Toronto, posing for photos with residents and unveiling his party’s newest campaign pledge: a move to restrict handguns, ban assault-style rifles and begin buying back military-grade weapons that were legally purchased. He made the announcement near to the site of a gun rampage last year, when Faisal Hussain shot 15 people, killing two. “As long as Canadians are losing their loved ones to gun violence, not enough has changed,” said Trudeau of the proposed ban. “We know you do not need a military-grade assault weapon, one designed to kill the largest amount of people in the shortest amount of time, to take down a deer.” The move to heavily restrict certain firearms is likely to set up a fight between the Liberals, Conservatives and the gun lobby. But after his embarrassing week, Trudeau is likely to be keen to move past the events that left his campaign team scrambling. Even Donald Trump weighed in on the scandal, telling reporters in the Oval office on Friday he was “surprised” by the “number of times” Trudeau appeared in photos. After issuing his second apology on Thursday, the prime minister was unable to say how many times he used brownface – or if more images might surface.   Related: Justin Trudeau's brownface scandal is bad. But voting him out isn't the solution | Moustafa Bayoumi    “I am wary of being definitive about this,” said Trudeau, telling reporters he didn’t admit to the third instance because he didn’t remember it occurring. “The fact is that I didn’t understand how hurtful this is to people who live with discrimination every single day. I have always acknowledged that I come from a place of privilege but I now need to acknowledge that that comes with a massive blind spot.” Two days after the first image was published by Time magazine, the Liberal party has circled the wagons around their leader; there have been no public calls for Trudeau to step down and numerous candidates have expressed support for the prime minister, while also acknowledging the offensive nature of the incident. “I think the real measure of the man, and I think the thing we need to be talking about, is all the amazing things we have done for diversity,” said Greg Fergus, a member of the federal Black Caucus and a Liberal MP, on Thursday. “The Justin Trudeau I have come to know over the past four years is a champion of diversity and inclusion,” said Amarjeet Sohi in a tweet. Following the firearms announcement, it is unclear if the policy announcement – in which Trudeau accused Conservatives of looking to “gut” the country’s gun laws – will force parties to shift gears or to continue their attack on the prime minister for the photographs. The leader of the Conservative party, Andrew Scheer, has previously said Trudeau has lost the “moral authority” to govern following the prime minister’s two apologies for the racist images. A unified party front is critical for the prime minister: as Trudeau looks to renew his parliamentary majority in an upcoming federal election, opinion polls shows him in a tight race against his Conservative rival, but the prime minister still holds in projected seats. Despite trading barbs on the campaign trail, the leaders have yet to face each other on the debate stage. Trudeau skipped the first event in mid-September, opting instead to hold a campaign rally. The leaders will meet for the first time on 7 October, in advance of the 21 October election.",2019-09-20 18:50:38+02:00

Certainly not an afro-wig wearing, Banana Boat-singing, face-blacking one. Though, admittedly, he did do all those racist things and possibly more – it’s hard to know because he says he can’t remember. If we know one thing about Trudeau, it’s that he loves people, all people. Especially “racialised Canadians”, as he now calls them, using the parlance of the day. Trudeau admires people of colour so much that when he found himself at a party dressed as Aladdin, he was happy to throw his arms around two genuinely racialised Canadians and grin boldly for the camera. Real racists don’t do that kind of thing, even in Canada, which, for all its progressiveness, can also be backward, especially in the highest circles of its cosmopolitan elite. Feel free to Google “the history of blackface in Quebec”, Trudeau’s prosperous home province, if you’re struggling to grasp how the 29-year-old son of a Liberal party prime minister thought it a hilarious idea to smear shoe polish on his face and, what’s more, for a party at the high school where he taught. Canada is an extraordinary country, but it isn’t the progressive utopia Trudeau wants it to be. Instead, it’s a decentralised collection of sparsely populated provinces and territories, a mosaic rather than a melting pot, as all good Canadian schoolchildren are taught. The country has long struggled to find a cohesive identity beyond its extreme climate and moderate aversion to conflict. Canadians are, for the most part, a nice lot, but as Trudeau showed us last week, niceness alone won’t save us. Trudeau can’t wish away the rising tide of populism that’s about to wash away his sunny ways any more than he can those dreadful pictures. But wishful thinking and shining intentions have long been Trudeau’s shtick and, when that fails, he loves a good apology. He’s such a fan of acknowledging past wrongs it’s become cultural policy. Every morning in many Canadian schools, children listen to an acknowledgment of the indigenous people on whose stolen land they are lucky to be standing. A good idea. But impoverished indigenous youth still continue to kill themselves at an alarming rate (there were huge demonstrations about the issue last week) and 50 communities are still living on “boil water” advisories. Trudeau’s working on the issue, he really is, but in the meantime lip service will have to do. In his contrition-fest of press conferences last week, he acknowledged that he comes from “a place of privilege” and that it was this provenance that deluded him into thinking that blacking up was just goofing around. This admission, more than anything else, gets to the heart of why Canadian moderates are losing faith in the man who once delighted us by cuddling baby pandas and grooving it out with drag queens on Pride Day. There’s the feeling he’ll do anything to please an audience and consider the consequences later. In Trudeau’s words, it was only years later when he became an MP for a culturally and economically diverse Montreal constituency that he realised that blacking up was wrong. The press conference went on like this for several minutes – journalists tut-tutting, Trudeau displaying his vulnerabilities like a labrador rolling over for a tummy rub – until a reporter stuck it to him in the most politely Canadian way.    It's great you're denouncing racism, but the prime minister's job was not created so you could work through your issues    It’s great that you’re denouncing racism, the reporter said, “but the prime minister’s job was not created so you could work through your issues”. Then he plunged the blade deeper and twisted. “Maybe it’s time you realise that you are not the indispensable man.”  For progressive Canadians, the concern about Trudeau was never that he was a power-mongering closet racist, just that he was a bit too soft for the job. This despite his former attorney general’s assertion that she was inappropriately pressured by his office – another badly handled scandal that has hobbled him.  Trudeau has only two modes: empathising and grovelling. Irrespective of his mystifying youthful makeup choices, neither mode has proved an effective weapon against the blandly malignant siren call of Tory rival Andrew Sheer’s populism. And that’s the real reason he’s failing. It’s not that we don’t believe he’s sincere – it’s that his sincerity has been revealed as a form of stupidity, a blindspot of privilege that undermines his project as a whole. • This article was amended on 27 September 2019 to clarify that many, but not all, Canadian schools have a policy of routinely acknowledging the relationship to the land of indigenous peoples. • Leah McLaren is a Canadian novelist and journalist",2019-09-21 19:19:00+02:00

The 16-year-old Swede met privately with the Canadian prime minister but later told a news conference with local indigenous leaders that he was “not doing enough” to curb greenhouse gases responsible for global warming. 
“My message to all the politicians around the world is the same. Just listen and act on the current best available science,” she said. 
Thunberg generated headlines around the world earlier this week with her viral so-called “How Dare You?” speech at the UN climate summit, accusing world leaders of betraying her generation. 
The teenager has inspired millions of youths, drawn to her cause by her passion and a mature, committed rhetorical style that belies her young age.

She has also drawn mockery from some, including Donald Trump, who tweeted sarcastically that “she seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future”. 
Without naming the US president, Thunberg said she didn’t “understand why grown-ups would choose to mock children and teenagers for just communicating and acting on the science when they could do something good instead”. 
“We’ve become too loud for people to handle so people want to silence us … We should also take that as a compliment.” Trudeau and other Canadian party leaders took a breather from a tight election campaign to join Thunberg at the Montreal rally – along with around 500,000 protesters, according to organizers. 
Walking with his wife and children, Trudeau mingled with a boisterous crowd that brandished placards reading “Respect Mother Earth” and “Make America Greta Again” – a riff on a campaign slogan popularized by Trump, a noted climate change skeptic. 
One man was tackled by security when he appeared to lunge at the prime minister, while 13-year-old Annabelle Vellend broke out in tears when she spotted Thunberg, telling AFP: “I really believe in Greta’s movement.” 
“She is doing amazing things and it’s great that she’s able to press politicians to act on climate change, during an election,” she said. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
In his first term, Trudeau cast himself as a champion in the fight against global warming, but his green image was tarnished by his nationalization of an oil pipeline to salvage the construction project after years of delay. 
The prime minister said after meeting Thunberg and pledging to fund the planting of 2bn trees: “I agree with her entirely. We need to do more.”

Earlier this week, the Liberal leader vowed that Canada would reach net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, joining 66 other countries that have already signed on to the pledge. 
Last Friday, more than 4 million youths – and adults – rallied in “climate strikes” around the world. 
Turnout at events a week on was smaller, but still vocal. In Italy, hundreds of thousands of young people took to the streets while an estimated 40,000 protested outside New Zealand’s parliament. 
In Canada, events also attracted huge crowds in the capital, Ottawa; in Toronto; and in several other cities. 
In the heart of the giant Montreal march, Alexanne Lessard stood out in her tree costume. 
“I’m here for our future, to show our government that we the majority want to do something and that they can take big steps that will an impact,” she said. 
Daphnee Choquette said she came out for her baby girl, whom she carried with her. 
“It’s too late for us [older people], but not for them. We need to bring about change now,” she said.
