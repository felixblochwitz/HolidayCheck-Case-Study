Sophie Grégoire Trudeau announced Thursday evening that she had tested positive for the coronavirus and plans to remain in isolation for the next two weeks. Her symptoms have been described as mild. “Although I’m experiencing uncomfortable symptoms of the virus, I will be back on my feet soon,” she said in a statement. “Being in quarantine at home is nothing compared to other Canadian families who might be going through this and for those facing more serious health concerns.”   Related: Coronavirus: many infections spread by people yet to show symptoms – scientists    The prime minister remains “in good health with no symptoms” according to his office, but will work in remotely for the next two weeks. He plans to address Canadians on Friday. Fears earlier today that Grégoire Trudeau might have contracted the virus while in London prompted the prime minister to work from home, derailing a planned meeting with premiers to discuss the economic fallout from the coronavirus and the recent plunge in oil prices. As a country that relies heavily on the export of fossil fuels, concerns are mounting that Canada is precariously close to a recession. On Wednesday, his government announced a $1bn dollar plan to address mounting concerns over the virus, including additional funding for medical research. He and deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland plan to speak with provincial leaders by phone tomorrow. Trudeau’s decision to self-isolate follows two members of his cabinet – trade minister Mary Ng and natural resources minister Seamus O’Regan – also choosing to self isolate in recent days. Both O’Regan and Trudeau recently attended a large mining conference in Toronto where one person was subsequently diagnosed with Covid-19. Health officials have asked all 25,000 people who attended to monitor for any symptoms of the coronavirus. New Democratic party leader Jagmeet Singh has also chosen to self-isolate after becoming ill. “I have been in contact with a doctor and they do not believe I have symptoms consistent with Covid-19. But their advice is for me to limit contact with the public until I am feeling better,” he tweeted. To date, Canada has 140 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and one death. Seventeen new cases were announced in Ontario, the most populous province, on Thursday. None of the new cases appear to have been spread through the community, said officials, and instead were found in people who recently travelled.",2020-03-13 04:42:11+01:00

Anger grows at US administration’s Covid-19 testing failures 
The coronavirus has reached the corridors of world power, with the Canadian leader, Justin Trudeau, in self-isolation after his wife Sophie tested positive, and the first case of Covid-19 at UN headquarters in New York. Donald Trump, however, has no plans to be tested for the virus, despite direct contact with at least one person later diagnosed with the disease. Anger continues to build over the administration’s bungled response. This US president, writes Julian Borger, is the worst possible man for the moment. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
Satellite images showing mass graves in the Iranian city of Qom suggest the epidemic there has grown worse than authorities admit, while a nurse in Italy has likened the fight against the virus there to a “world war”. Here are some data visualisations to help understand the crisis, and a roundup of the latest developments worldwide. 
 
 Free prisoners. Doctors, as well as legal and health advocates, have called for low-risk US prison inmates to be freed to help curb the spread of the coronavirus outbreak in prisons. 
 Food service. The crisis has led to renewed demands for more paid sick leave in the food service industry, where only 15% of workers are supported financially if they take time off. 
 Campus closures. Universities and colleges across the US have stopped in-person classes, moved their teaching online and sent students home in response to the Covid-19 crisis. 
 
US launches retaliatory airstrikes against militia in Iraq

US forces have launched retaliatory airstrikes on what the Pentagon described as five weapons storage sites run by Kata’ib Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed militia thought to have been responsible for a rocket attack that killed two American and one British soldier near Baghdad earlier this week. The US defense secretary, Mark Esper, told reporters on Thursday: “You don’t get to shoot at our bases and kill and wound Americans and get away with it.” 
 
 Tit-for-tat. The attacks come two months after a similar escalation of hostilities threatened all-out conflict between the US and Iran. This time, however, both sides are more preoccupied tackling domestic outbreaks of the coronavirus. 
 
Judge orders Chelsea Manning released after suicide attempt

A federal judge has ordered Chelsea Manning be released from jail in Virginia, days after the former US army analyst attempted to take her own life. Manning has been held since May 2019 after refusing to testify to a grand jury investigating Wikileaks, to whom she leaked hundreds of thousands of documents in 2010. But Judge Anthony J Trenga wrote that “the grand jury is no longer needed, in light of which her detention no longer serves any coercive purpose.” 
 
 Previous sentence. Manning previously served six years in custody for her part in the 2010 leak. President Barack Obama commuted her 35-year sentence shortly before the end of his time in office.

 Chinese government records show the first case of Covid-19 was detected on 17 November last year, and that a 55-year-old from Hubei province may have been the first person to contract the virus. 
 Disney has announced it will shut down Disneyland and its other US parks over fears about the coronavirus outbreak, as well as suspending any new cruise ship departures. 
 Immigration lawyers and activists have condemned recent Ice arrests of Latino immigrants outside courthouses in California, saying courts should remain “safe spaces”. 
 Following Harvey Weinstein’s sentencing this week, actor Kate Beckinsale recalled the time the film mogul had subjected her to an expletive-filled rant, claiming she had “ruined” a film premiere by wearing a suit instead of a tight dress.

Emily Blunt: A Quiet Place 2 and a world ‘untethered by fear’ 
The new sequel to A Quiet Place, the harrowing self-isolation horror from 2017, is about “human beings and how they’re affected by a crisis,” its star Emily Blunt tells Aaron Hicklin. Ironic, then, that its release has been delayed by just such a crisis. 
The Sanders fans who will never vote for Biden 
Some of Bernie Sanders’ most diehard supporters say it’s Bernie or bust: they will only vote in November if they can vote for the progressive Vermont senator. Their numbers remain unclear, but their influence is undeniable. Ankita Rao reports. 
The rise of the pop-star scripted documentary 
Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga are just some of the major musical stars who, in recent years, have collaborated in and co-created documentaries about their own lives. But the best films are still the ones that show them in more spontaneous, unguarded moments, says Simran Hans. 
I was kidnapped and taken to the desert 
When she was 15, Nadine Guerrera was snatched from her home in Connecticut by strange men, and taken against her will to a desert in Utah. It turned out she had been sent on an extreme wilderness programme for difficult children – paid for by her own parents. 
Opinion 
China has been criticised for its lack of transparency about the coronavirus outbreak. Now, the Trump administration is following suit. The president’s rhetoric will make this pandemic worse, says H Holden Thorp, the editor-in-chief of Science. 
Sport 
Sporting competitions all over the globe are shutting up shop in the face of the pandemic, from March Madness to the Australian F1 Grand Prix. England’s Premier League looks likely to do the same after Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta and players from Chelsea and Leicester City in self-isolation. 
Carlos Cordeiro has quit as the president of the US Soccer Federation, days after the organization filed legal papers claiming the national team’s female players were less skilled than their male counterparts. He will be replaced by Cindy Parlow Cone, the federation’s first female president.

The wife of the Canadian prime minister was also photographed at the Wembley Arena We Day event on 4 March alongside the F1 driver Lewis Hamilton and the actor Idris Elba. On the same day Grégoire Trudeau also went to an International Women’s Day conference attended by the former supreme court president Lady Hale.  
It is feared Grégoire Trudeau may have contracted the virus during her London trip. She reported feeling unwell following her return to Canada earlier this week.

The 4 March event was organised by the development charity We, an organisation for which Trudeau serves as a wellbeing ambassador. 
She was introduced on stage by Lewis, who greeted her with a hug. Video of the event also shows her patting and kissing her fellow speaker, Gillard. Other celebrities at the event included the chef Jamie Oliver, the actor Alfie Allen, the singer Calum Scott and the model Adwoa Aboah. Grégoire Trudeau went to the event with her daughter Ella-Grace and mother-in-law Margaret Trudeau. 
 
  
 
Grégoire Trudeau also attended an International Women’s Day conference at Canada House hosted by the Canadian high commissioner Janice Charette. Among the guests were the former president of the supreme court Lady Hale. 
A supreme court spokeswoman said: “All justices are aware of the Public Health England guidance and are taking the necessary actions like everyone else.” 
Global Affairs Canada has been approached for comment. Four days after the conference, Charette tweeted pictures of attendees, including one of her close to Grégoire Trudeau.

During her London trip, Grégoire Trudeau also went to the Oxo Tower gallery for an exhibition of women’s photography organised by the charity ActionAid. A member of staff at the gallery said the gallery was considering what steps to take following news of Grégoire Trudeau’s positive test, but declined to comment further.

Trudeau announced on Thursday evening that she had tested positive for coronavirus and planned to remain in isolation for the next two weeks. Her symptoms have been described as mild. 
In a statement, We said it had “not received indications of health concerns from any participants or other speakers at the event”. But it said it would continue to monitor this and was being advised by the NHS. 
As a precaution, the organisation has also asked staff to work from home and cancelled all future events. 
Hamilton, Elba, Gillard and Lewis have all been contacted for comment. None have reported symptoms of the virus.

We will get through this together,” said the prime minister, who has been in self-isolation after his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday.   Related: Fears grow Sophie Grégoire Trudeau picked up coronavirus on London trip    In his address on Friday, Trudeau said he remained symptom free. “Of course, [working from home] is an inconvenience and somewhat frustrating. We are all social beings after all,” he said. “But we have to do this because we have to protect our neighbours and our friends – especially our more vulnerable seniors and people with pre-existing conditions.” Officials announced a raft of new measures including closing parliament for five weeks and redirecting incoming international flights to a small number of airports as part of enhanced screening measures. The government also announced it will ban cruise ships with 500 people from docking in the country’s ports until 1 July – but stopped short of closing the borders. “Borders don’t stop travellers. Travellers find other ways into countries. Travellers become less honest,” said Patty Hajdu, the county’s health minister. “Canada’s approach from the very beginning has been to use science and evidence.” Instead, the government has asked Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside the country and to limit contact with crowds. “Social distancing is an important contribution that everyone can make to our control efforts,” said Theresa Tam, the country’s chief public health officer. “This means avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings, considering shopping or taking public transport in off-peak hours and greeting one another with a wave or elbow instead of a handshake, kiss or hug.” So far, Canada has conducted more than 15,000 tests and has 157 confirmed cases of the virus, most of which have been found in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia, she said. Despite the relatively low number of cases, the federal government and provinces have acted swiftly in recent days. British Columbia, Alberta and Quebec have all banned events larger than 250 people. Ontario, the country’s most populous province, will close schools for two additional weeks following spring break, as will Quebec. Late on Friday, officials in Toronto, the country’s largest city, announced the closure of all child care facilities, public libraries and community centres. They also announced the surprise cancellation of all spring break camps and urged residents to reconsider taking public transit. “The actions you take today will save lives,” Hajdu said. “This is a serious public health threat, and a crisis as well as an emergency.” Experts cautioned that no clear blueprints yet exist on now to stem the spread of the virus — but said that certain measures have shown degrees of success. “There’s no complete science behind any of it really — but it’s worthwhile to explore different ways of trying to control things,” said infectious disease specialist Dr. Susy Hota, medical director of prevention and control at Toronto’s university health network.  “That’s where the social distancing makes sense to consider doing it early and trying to reduce the overall impact on everybody.” As the country prepares for an economic slowdown, driven by both the coronavirus and a plunge in oil prices, Trudeau said his government plans to green-light a wide-scale economic stimulus plan in the coming days. “We are in the enviable position of having significant fiscal firepower available,” he said. Alberta’s premier, Jason Kenny, has called on the federal government to announce a stimulus of at least C$20bn (US$14.3bn) – roughly 1% of the country’s gross domestic product – to offset the looming economic impact of the virus. “We need to design policies that will really help liquidity and cashflow for businesses that are uniquely affected right now,” he said on Thursday. The prime minister has not yet put a figure on the stimulus plan, but said the action will target Canadians who are most vulnerable to a downturn. “No one should have to worry about paying rent, buying groceries, or additional childcare because of Covid-19. We will help Canadians financially.”",2020-03-13 19:19:22+01:00

Canada is no exception,” Trudeau, speaking from outside his home where he is in self-imposed quarantine after his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau tested positive for the virus last week. “We assured you that as the situation evolved, our response would evolve too as the virus continues it spread. We’ve decided to take increasingly aggressive steps to keep you and your family safe. “All Canadians as much as possible should stay home,” he said. Trudeau said the borders will remain open for shipping, but said his government will restrict flights to Canada to airports in four major cities: Toronto Pearson, Montreal-Trudeau, Vancouver international and Calgary international. The move to close its borders contrasts with previous comments from the country’s health minister, Patty Hajdu, who rejected the idea on Friday. But in recent days, Canada has experienced a surge in cases, prompting the country’s chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, to warn residents that the chance to prevent the healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed is closing fast.   Related: Covid-19 outbreak: what do health experts mean by 'flattening the curve'?    “Our window to flatten the curve of the epidemic is narrow,” Tam said over the weekend. “We all need to act now. Covid-19 is a serious public health threat.” Canada now has 377 confirmed cases of the coronavirus – more than double Friday’s figures. On Monday morning, the province of Ontario announced 17 testing sites and a C$10m (US$7.2m) public awareness campaign, as well as emergency legislation that would bar companies from laying off employees who have to self-quarantine. “We’re facing rough waters ahead,” the premier, Doug Ford, told reporters. “We will get through this together.” His government also plans to include protections for parents at home caring for children. The province announced 32 new cases, bringing the provincial total to 177 –&nbsp;making it the region with the highest concentration of infections. “[The law] will be in place until this disease is defeated” said the province’s minister of labour, Monte McNaughton. “People who are infected should be able to do the right thing.” Over the weekend, the province of Alberta chose to shut down all public schools, joining a number of other provinces that have previously announced closures – and warning that the schools may stay closed for the rest of the academic year. “This pandemic will not end in a matter of weeks, and there won’t be a clear opportunity to reopen schools, likely not until September at the earliest,” said the province’s chief medical officer of health, Dr Deena Hinshaw. Other provinces have taken more extreme measures. Quebec has told all bars, clubs and gyms to close and called on residents to practice social distancing and to remain at home when possible. Despite the varied responses to the outbreak across the country, Trudeau urged unity. “The strength of our country is our capacity to come together and care for each other, especially in times of need. So call your friends, check in with your family. Think of your community,” he said.",2020-03-16 19:45:31+01:00
